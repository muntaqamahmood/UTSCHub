# Release Planning Meeting

The release planning meeting was held in our standup channel in the CSCC01 Discord on October 5th, 2022. All of our team members attended the release planning meeting. In this meeting, we discussed our application's main features, key users, and the goal of the release.

## Release Goal

- Sprint 1: Learn new technologies such as React, SQL, Node Js, and CSS and start working on the user stories, such as sign up, log in, navigation bar, and profile page.

- Sprint 2: Work on user stories, where users can access the market page with all its functionality with a user-friendly user interface.

- Sprint 3: Work on additional user stories, where users can access the events and message page and are able to easily book for events and message their peers.

- Sprint 4: Build a fully functional and user-friendly web application where users can purchase items on the market page, attend events through the events page, and message fellow UTSC students, with little to no bugs tampering with the application.

## Project Scope:

- Users must be able to sign up to create an account `(TA-1)`, login `(TA-2)` in an authenticated manner `(TA-3)`, log out, and delete their account `(TA-6)`.

- Users should be able to navigate the market page, where they can search for items `(TA-20)`, filter items `(TA-21)`, add new items `(TA-22)`, edit item information `(TA-23)`, and delete items they are selling `(TA-24)`.

- Users must be able to have their profile page `(TA-4)`, where they can add profile pictures `(TA-26)`, edit their profile `(TA-27)`, have a list of items they are selling `(TA-28)` and have a list of items ordered `(TA-29)`. 

- On the market page, users should be able to save items to their profile `(TA-30)`, get items added to their cart `(TA-31)`, and comment on items posted `(TA-32)`.

- Users should be able to navigate the events page `(TA-33)`, create events `(TA-34)`, and search for events `(TA-35)`.

- Users should be able to navigate the SNS page, where they can message fellow users `(TA-36)` and search for who to chat with `(TA-37)`.
